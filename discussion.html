  <div class="testing"><h2>Testing</h2><p>To test out the solar greenhouse we dividend the system into 2 parts, power and water. For the water test we assembled and ran water through the system and found no leaks. For the electrical part we ran it for 12h so it could run. Then we combined the full system and ran it completely. Our results showed that everything was working as intended. The tubing was fully sealed, and the code uploaded with ease. The assembly was still complicated and could use some improvement and the cost has a long way to go.
  </p></div>
<div class="feedback_and_improvment"><h2>Feedback and Improvement</h2><p>
  After speaking to both our teacher and our classmate Yosef, we noticed that the Solar Greenhouse had a flaw. To start the alarm was too quiet and therefore when outdoors not audible. Also our classmate said “With this setup you might as well sell the idea to ikea”. For the next version we will fix these issues by using a bluetooth attached alarm. For the assembly we can try to make a more costly preassembled version for sale on our website.  The water going out of the rain barrel could also be contaminated and not suitable for edible food so a filtration system may be necessary. In addition to all those, it would make sense to add a configuration menu like most products on the market. We realized this after observing that most products have configuration.

<div class="future_plans"><h2>How</h2><p>To make the prototype we spent most of our time planning out the design and doing research. The prototype was soldered together and we used fish tank tubing due to its ease of attachment.</p></div>
<div class="business_plans"><h2>Business Plans</h2><p>Our plan to sell the Solar Greenhouse is to start at the low price of 50$ for a kit. This kit (in addition to a few things from home) will have everything you need to get started. We will initially invest in an ecommerce plan with advertising on social media to get started. To start our products will be going to people, not business so we will be going with a b2c model. To start off the ecommerce site there will be a promotion for referring friends. We estimate that with a future finished product the solar greenhouse will be bringing in about 50,000 a year to start. After we have our roots planted we will start to grow our market to governments, charities, and other corporations.</p></div>
