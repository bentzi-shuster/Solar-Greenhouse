<content-card lable="Thesis">The solar greenhouse is a minimal effort gardening tool. It is maintained by rainwater and sunlight so you can sit back and relax.</content-card>
     
  
<content-card lable="Abstract">This project is a fully automated solar powered greenhouse. This project will be able to make a self-sustainable farm that requires only planting and harvesting. This project will work by having the greenhouse automate the correct amounts of nutrients to feed. It will also measure and regulate other important factors, like temperature. We made the solar greenhouse based on a timer because hydrometer sensors tend to decay. Our goal with this project is to make a high quality solar powered greenhouse that needs minimal maintenance. The design all starts with a rain barrel collecting water. From there it's pumped out to the plants on a timer using a real time clock module. We also use a float switch to determine the water level in the barrel and trigger an alarm. All the wiring is in a water proof box to avoid short circuiting. The whole greenhouse is powered through a solar cell with a battery to store power. The solar greenhouse is meant for small hobbyists and charities who can't afford the heavy machinery and staff that a farm has. It can be bought for a low price and will not result in an exorbitant power bill. The solar greenhouse will revolutionize the garden market and make gardening more accessible.</content-card>
   
<content-card lable="Pitch">I’ve done it, you’ve done it, haven't we all. Don't you hate it when you leave the hose on and your crops get flooded. There are some solutions that fix this but they block the hose and the whole system can be improved. That's why we made Solar greenhouse, to remove human interaction from gardening. The Solar Greenhouse uses a solar technology to power itself while collecting and storing rainwater to automatically water the plants. This makes the solar greenhouse a set and forget solution for the common worker,or charity.
