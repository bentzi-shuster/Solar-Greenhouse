<content-card lable="Thesis">The Solar Greenhouse is a minimal effort gardening tool maintained by rainwater and sunlight so you can sit back and relax.</content-card>
     
  
<content-card lable="Abstract">This fully-automated, solar-powered greenhouse will be able to create a self-sustainable farm that requires only planting and harvesting. The Solar greenhouse, based on a timer avoids hydrometer sensors as they tend to decay. Our goal is to make a high-quality solar-powered greenhouse that needs minimal maintenance. The design all starts with a rain barrel collecting water. From there water is pumped out to the plants on a timer using a real time clock(RTC) module. We used a float switch to determine the water level in the barrel and trigger an alarm. All the wiring is in a waterproof box to avoid a short circuit. The whole greenhouse is powered through a solar cell to store power. The Solar Greenhouse, meant for small hobbyists and charities, help those who can afford the heavy machinery and staff that a farm requires. The cost are low and usage will not result in an exorbitant electricity bill. The Solar Greenhouse will revolutionize the garden market and make gardening more accessible to the average "Joe".</content-card>
   
<content-card lable="Pitch">I’ve done it. You’ve done it. Haven't we all? Don't you hate it when you leave the hose on and your crops get flooded? There are some solutions that fix this; but they block the hose and the whole system can be improved. That's why we made Solar Greenhouse-- to remove human interaction from gardening. The Solar Greenhouse uses a solar technology to power itself while collecting and storing rainwater to automatically irrigate the plants. This makes the Solar Greenhouse a set-and-forget solution for the common worker, or charity.
