    This product, a necessity for the farmer, will eradicate the need for human interaction. This will turn the farming into a set-and-forget system powered by nature itself. Our proudct will make farming more accessible to the people who are working during the spring and summer and will be a great addition to any farmers tool box. This can also be funded by governments and charities to help support lower class communities. According to Amazon.com there are thousands of people who want solar timers;however , this is not the full market we are targeting. According to https://www.hobbyfarms.com/water-your-garden-with-water-timers/  non-gardeners like those at a charities will also benifit from our product.The EPA (https://www.epa.gov/soakuptherain/soak-rain-rain-barrels#:~:text=Rain%20barrels%20capture%20water%20from,for%20use%20in%20your%20landscape.) also mentions that a rain barrel is an excalent way to conserve water. 
    We also contacted Home Depot's gardening department and explained the project we wish to attempt. The customer service manager informed us that people may not want to spend for the rain barrel as they are costly.

<div class="survay_results"><h2>Survey Results</h2><p style="font-size: 20px;" >We asked 66 non-gardeners if they would consider gardening with the Solar Greenhouse.

Benson Kramer - "so I don't need to water my plants … that's cool"<br>
Benny Gluck - "I will definitely buy it"<br>
Joe Sideman - " if I can be lazy than I like it"<br>

<div class="market_research"><h2>Market Research</h2><p style="font-size: 2em;" > We are looking to find around five thousand consumers from the farming and chariy communities for our project to start. As we grow that will include the general population. We will be targeting the communities with advertising on common gardening websites and by making deals with small businesses.</p></div>
<div class="compeditors"><h2>Competitors</h2><p>Our project stands out from others because of its integrated alarm system. This system notifies the owner of the greenhouse when there is a lack of resources, for example water. This is important because nothing else on the market interacts with the owner, and this feature is crucial to the greenhouse. This project is also less expensive and easier to maintain than other products on the market. Our greenhouse can also be set up anywhere regardless of outlet location or hose.
